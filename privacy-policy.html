  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how SportGroup ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information
    when you use our mobile application (the "App").

  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Training and Attendance Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Training details (e.g., title, description, training date, training time)</li>
    <li>Attendance data (whether a player was marked present for a training session)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Technical and Usage Information</h3>
  <p>
    We may process basic technical information necessary for the App to function reliably and securely, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device and app information (e.g., app version)</li>
    <li>Network and error logs (to diagnose crashes and improve stability)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage user accounts and authenticate logins</li>
    <li>Provide the core functionality of the App (trainings, players, attendance, statistics)</li>

    <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues</li>
    <li>Improve the App’s performance and user experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, we process personal data under the following legal bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the App and its features</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve the App</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required by law (e.g., optional communications, if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share information only as described below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service providers:</strong> We use third-party services to host and operate the App backend.
      For example, we use <strong>Supabase</strong> for authentication and database storage. These providers process data
      on our behalf to deliver the App’s functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to comply with applicable law,
      lawful requests, or to protect rights, safety, and security.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including access controls and secure transmission where applicable.
    However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You use the App at your own risk.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the App and its features, comply with legal obligations,
    resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You may request deletion of your account and associated data as described below.

    <li>Request portability of your data (where applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights, contact us at the email address in the Contact section. We may need to verify your identity before processing requests.

  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the age of 15 (or the minimum age required in your country).
    We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal data,
    please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Your data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own, depending on where our service providers operate.
    We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when required by law.
  </p>
